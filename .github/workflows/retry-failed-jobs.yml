# This workflow is dispatched by the retry-failed-jobs job in ci.yml.
# It receives the CI run ID, waits for that run to complete, and then
# calls reRunWorkflowFailedJobs to re-run only the failed jobs.
#
# Why a separate workflow? reRunWorkflowFailedJobs cannot be called on
# a workflow that is still running. The CI workflow is still "in progress"
# while the retry-failed-jobs job runs, so it must delegate to this
# external workflow which waits for CI to finish first.
